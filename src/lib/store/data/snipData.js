 * TODO Sort array by date helper fxn
 *
 * Poems / Prose
 * Articles
 * Lorem is Ipsum (No, Really).
 *
 * 📚 Payhip (similar to Gumroad, even more discreet)
 * 📘 Gumroad (great for pseudonymous creators)
 * 📖 Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)
 * 🌐 Itch.io (underrated for zine-style or experimental writing)
 *  - Originally built for indie games, but increasingly used by writers and artists.
 *  - You can create an anonymous storefront and sell zines, PDFs, ebooks.
 *  - The vibe is alt/indie—great if your writing is creative or hybrid (like poetry-meets-code, or visual/therapeutic metaphors).
 * * 🖥️ Ko-fi (similar to Patreon, but more casual)
